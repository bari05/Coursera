				<p id="p1" class="bg1">Strategy</p>
				<p id="p2">Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. The Strategy pattern lets you indirectly alter the object’s behavior at runtime by associating it with different sub-objects which can perform specific sub-tasks in different ways.</p>

			<div>
				<p id="p1" class="bg2">Singleton</p>
				<p id="p2">Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.</p>

			<div>
				<p id="p1" class="bg3">Decorator</p>
				<p id="p2">Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.</p>
